## 1 Preface

### 1.1 Aim of the specification

This E-ARK specification is part of a family of specifications that provide a common set of requirements for packaging digital information. These specifications are based on common, international standards for transmitting, describing and preserving digital data. They have been produced to help data creators, software developers and digital archives tackle the challenge of short-, medium- and long-term data management and reuse in a sustainable, authentic, cost-efficient, manageable and interoperable way. 

The foundation for these specifications is the Reference Model for an Open Archival Information System (OAIS) which has Information Packages at its core. Familiarity with the core functional entities of OAIS is a prerequisite for understanding the specifications. A visualisation of the current specification network can be seen here:

### 1.2 Organisational support

This specification is maintained by the Digital Information LifeCycle Interoperability Standards Board (DILCIS Board). The DILCIS Board ([http://dilcis.eu/](http://dilcis.eu/)) was created to enhance and maintain the draft specifications developed in the European Archival Records and Knowledge Preservation Project (E-ARK project) which concluded in January 2017 ([http://eark-project.com/](http://eark-project.com/)<span style="text-decoration:underline;">)</span>. The Board consists of eight members, but there is no restriction on the number of participants in the work. All Board documents and specifications are stored in GitHub ([https://github.com/DILCISBoard](https://github.com/DILCISBoard)) while published versions are made available on the Board webpage. Since 2018 the DILCIS Board has been responsible for the core specifications in the Connecting Europe Facility eArchiving Building Block ([https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/CEFDIGITAL/eArchiving](https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/CEFDIGITAL/eArchiving)<span style="text-decoration:underline;">)</span>.

## 2 Context


### 2.1 Purpose

The purpose of this document is to describe the Content Information Type Specification for Relational Databases (RDB) using the format Software Independent Archiving of Relational Databases (SIARD). The specification is designed to be used for the transfer to and from archives. This specification is supported by an XML-schema and a Schematron document which includes rules that the XML-schema cannot validate. 


### 2.2 Layered data model

This section introduces the structure of the data model, which is based on a layered approach for information package definitions (Figure x). The Common Specification for Information Packages (CSIP) forms the outermost layer. The general SIP, AIP and DIP specifications add, respectively, submission, archiving and dissemination information to the CSIP specification. The third layer of the model represents specific content information type specifications, such as this CITS SIARD specification. Additional layers for business-specific specifications and local variant implementations of any specification can be added. 

 ![](pictures/Data_Model_Structure.png)


**Figure 1: Data Model Structure**

Every level in the data model structure inherits metadata entities and elements from the higher levels. In order to increase adoption, a flexible schema has been developed. This will allow for extension points where the schema in each layer can be extended to accommodate additional information on the next specific layer until, finally, the local implementation can add specific entities or metadata elements to satisfy very specific local needs. Extension points can be implemented by:



*   Embedding foreign extension schemas (in the same way as supported by METS [[http://www.loc.gov/standards/mets/](http://www.loc.gov/standards/mets/)] and PREMIS [[http://www.loc.gov/standards/premis/](http://www.loc.gov/standards/premis/)]). These support both increasing the granularity of existing metadata elements by using more detailed data structures as well as adding new types of metadata.
*   Substituting metadata schemas for standards more appropriate for the local implementation.  

The structure allows the addition of more detailed requirements for metadata entities, for example by:



*   Increasing the granularity of metadata elements by using more detailed data structures, or 
*   Adding local controlled vocabularies.

For consistency, design principles are reused between layers as much as possible.


### 2.3 The boundaries of this specification and the SIARD-specification

SIARD is an independent format for archiving relational databases and hence has its own specification ([https://github.com/DILCISBoard/SIARD](https://github.com/DILCISBoard/SIARD)) but there are areas where the SIARD specification deliberately states that packaging of the SIARD-file among other aspect is outside the scope of the SIARD specification:


    _“It should be noted that the SIARD format is only the long-term storage format for a specific type of digital documents (relational databases) and is therefore designed entirely independently of package structures such as the SIP (Submission Information Package), AIP (Archival Information Package) and DIP (Dissemination Information Package) in the OAIS model. It is assumed that a database in SIARD format is archived as part of such an information package together with other documents (externalized large object files, translation maps for external file names, database documentation, business documents relevant to the understanding of the database, etc.).”_
 - SIARD 2.1.1, p. 7_

This CITS SIARD specification describes how to package SIARD-files and any accompanying external LOBs in CSIP package(s). This specification also describes how to package extra metadata and context documentation so that long term preservation and dissemination can take place. 

As in all classification issues it is important to have collectively exhaustive and mutually exclusive categories and even though the SIARD specification deliberately states that package structures are not part of the specification then there are circumstances and scenarios where it is not clear whether an issue falls under the scope of a specification like this one or under the scope of the SIARD specification itself.  

This CITS SIARD specification has been written during the eArchiving building block in the two-year E-ARK3-project and during this period the project participants have been struggling with issues that lie in the grey area between the two specifications.  In the E-ARK3-project the project participants have decided to create a Request For Comments (RFC) for an update to the SIARD specification which concentrates on large databases and external lobs. This CITS SIARD specification is therefore dependent on the outcome of that RFC and has been written as if the RFC has been adopted into the SIARD specification.




## 3 CITS SIARD Requirements


###   3.1 Folder structure and example

A visualisation of an example of a valid CITS SIARD-package is illustrated in Figure 4. The example and other examples can also be found as downloadable packages at this link: [https://github.com/DILCISBoard/SIARD-CITS/tree/master/examples](https://github.com/DILCISBoard/SIARD-CITS/tree/master/examples). The example is an information package where a database has LOBs that resides outside the .siard-file. See LOB details under section [3.8 {SIARD_lobs} -- requirements](#_sxv4sbhj2v7i) 14

**Figure 4: Information Package folder structure**


### 3.2 Package and Representation METS

A CSIP can consist of zero to many representations, and this is an important feature that needs to be taken into consideration when packing SIARD files within CSIPs. 

There can easily be different representations of the same database located within one CSIP. For example, one package could consist of:



*   one representation where the native proprietary dump is located; 
*   one representation with SIARD-file that conforms only to an older version of the SIARD specification; 
*   one representation with the newest version of the SIARD specification; 
*   one representation where database normalization and/or other dissemination tasks have taken place. 

There can be several DIP representations.  There can also be other databases and for example geodata within the same package. 

As for this specification there always needs to be a minimum of one representation and therefore a minimum of two METS.xml. The Package METS.xml has to be a general METS.xml describing if the package itself is mainly a CITS_SIARD package, and then the single representations need to describe what specific SIARD versions they consist of.

### 3.8 {SIARD_lobs} – requirements

A relational database can consist solely of table data, but it can as easily have large objects (LOBs). Large object (LOB) is the common description for large character content (CLOB) or large binary (BLOB) content - such as video, sound, images, word processing documents etc.

These LOBs can be stored inside a relational database as CLOBs or BLOBs within cells or outside as external files - also called external LOBs (SQL/MED). 

In the SIARD specification from SIARD2.0 and onwards the external LOBs can be placed outside the table data within the folder structure in the .siard-file or they can be placed outside the .siard-file. As stated in the scope of this specification there is work being done to create a RFC to the SIARD specification that handles large databases and LOBs.

   <td colspan="2" >LOBs <strong>MAY </strong>be stored in its own representation, and the value in mets/@csip:OTHERCONTENTINFORMATIONTYPE is “SIARD_lobs”.
<p>
For storage and preservation actions the OAIS can decide to handle LOBs in its own representation. This way there can be different representations of .siard-files that link to the same lob-representation. The complexity rises by choosing this solution and the CSIP states: “Representation level METS files should not reference files outside of their representation”. It therefore has to be a deliberate choice to allow this way of handling LOBs

## 4 SIP requirements


### 4.1 Submission Agreement requirements

There should be a submission agreement in the SIP representation that has been tailored to handle preservation of relational databases. Since no standard for submission agreements for databases exist yet, the following requirements are not yet able to be automatically validated at this specification level. It is up to the business specific specification layer or local implementation layer (see 1.2 Layered Data Model) to set up requirements that can be automatically validated.

## 5 AIP requirements

None yet.


## 6 DIP requirements

None yet.


## 7 Documentation requirements

There should be documentation in the representations and/or in the information package. Since no standard for documentation of databases exists yet, the following requirements are not yet able to be automatically validated at this specification level. It is up to the business specific specification layer or local implementation layer (see 1.2 Layered Data Model) to set up requirements that can be automatically validated.
